<PRE>
&gt;<i> Then, the creation of python wrapper for the importer. 
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Good to know there are at least 2 python fans amongst yade folks :-)
&lt;secret&gt; I had even such plans that all non-computational stuff (what
doesn't repeat during iterations) would be recoded in python, including
main, plugin manager, gui, serializer/deserializer. But I got blocked on
qglviewer now, which I need to run with qt4 (custom event loop, qt3
doesn't know that) and have no experience with such thing. &lt;/secret&gt;
&gt;<i> Next, a model for my own research (until I study the dynamics of dry bulk 
</I>&gt;<i> media), its profiling and optimization (I need 10k, a better 100k particles). 
</I>&gt;<i> Also plan to export results in any format (silo, vtk, hdf5?) for the 
</I>&gt;<i> postprocessing (paraview, visit?)... will be grateful for assistance in 
</I>&gt;<i> selecting... I am inclined now to vtk and paraview.
</I>Can't help you here, but I would be grateful to hear your experience on
that. What kind of postprocessing do you need? Fields plots, contours
and the like?

I am experimenting with matplotlib integration now, for advanced
plotting in yade, but that quite a different thing...
&gt;<i> And plan to add simple 
</I>&gt;<i> elastoplastic contact model.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>If you have your constitutive law formulated in terms of strain-stress
rather than displacements and so on, you could base that on BrefcomLaw.
I wanted to rename it to StrainStressLaw and use it as a base class for
almost arbitrary strain-stress models: just plug in some equations and
it's done. Didn't have time for that, though. And it is not (yet?) as
fast as I want it to be.

Regards, Vaclav
