<PRE>V&#225;clav S a &#233;crit :
&gt;&gt;<i> -The time that is really spent for mathematics and associated code is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> less than 7% for interaction geometry and less than 12% for ContactLaw 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (7 and 12 are estimates based on non-inclusive costs, i.e. time really 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spent in contact and geometry dyn libs) .
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> Bruno, these are really important numbers, many thanks. That also means
</I>&gt;<i> that I will not go on to vectorize (=multiplex) operations on vectors
</I>&gt;<i> and quaternions (addition of all 3 elements in one CPU instruction),
</I>&gt;<i> since that would yield very small speedups.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>That is THE big problem actualy, if you ask me. Each time you see a way 
to gain speed, you (I) realize that it is negligible compared to 
something else. Everything is a little bit slow, so that there is 
nothing you can do to significantly speed things up. I'm tempted to 
blame partly boost (I may be wrong though), which make every simple 
operation like shared_ptr(new something) or i++ (when i points to 
shared_ptr container)  slower than normal, and also some useless tests 
and operations in some containers (due to defensive programming most of 
the time).

Let me illustrate that point with the function 
PhysicalActionDamper::action ().

This dispatching function takes 10% of the total simulation time. It is 
supposed to damp force and momentum.

Guess what time is spent for actually damping? 5.7% for force and 5.7% 
for moment (i.e. 0.10*0.057 of total cpu time for each of 
CundallNonViscousForceDamping and CundallNonViscousMomentumDamping). 
Amazing isn't it? The damping dispatcher takes 89% of cpu time to do 
something else, namely :
- LocateMultivirtualFunctor : 50%
- PhysicalActionIterator::Increment : 6%
- BodyRedirectionVector::operator[] : 4%
-PhysicalActionVector::getValue() : 3%
-PhysicalActionVector::isDifferent() : 3%
- etc...

So that damping in a more efficient way would be totaly futile.

That is why I keep insisting for thinking about speed constantly. 
Because if one part is slow, everybody give up speeding things in his 
own area of interest, and we get a slow code as a result.

I really think I will try and merge some engines soon (same as Luc 
Sibille idea), to reduce container operations and see the result. But my 
impression is that containers themselves could be a lot faster, so that 
merging would be useless.

A simple example :

shared_ptr&lt;PhysicalAction&gt;&amp; PhysicalActionVectorVector::find(unsigned 
int id , int actionIndex )
{
    if( current_size &lt;= id ) // this is very rarely executed, only at 
beginning.
    // somebody is accesing out of bounds, make sure he will find, what 
he needs - a resetted PhysicalAction of his type
    {
        ....
    }
    usedIds[id] = true;
    return physicalActions[id][actionIndex];
}

1. There is this test at the begining, that is useless all the time 
except at iteration 1.
2. there is this usedIds[id] affectation (same remark again, only 
modified at iteration 1).
3. Then return a reference to a shared pointer (while shared_ptr 
operations are slower than normal).

Of course, this function &quot;find&quot; is used many many times. Result 3.81% of 
total CPU time just for it, while we could just use 
physicalActions[id][actionIndex] instead of find(), and reduce that time 
a lot. But of course physicalActions is private...

You may think 3.81% is negligible, yes, that is true, like everything 
else is negligible. That is the problem.

Janek : I know that containers will be changed anyway, and that is why I 
think this is the right moment to cry about speed. :)
Users don't care about Godwin's law, they need SPEED!!!

&gt;<i> Recently looking at interfaces of many classes (like containers),
</I>&gt;<i> methods are not properly marked const if they do not change the current
</I>&gt;<i> instance. That, I think, prevents many optimizations. Like,
</I>&gt;<i> container.size() should be declared as
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> class container{
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>  size_t size(void) const {...}
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, I thought to that too, but I was not expert enough to be sure. 
Can't the compiler check that nothing will be affected in some situations?

Bruno
