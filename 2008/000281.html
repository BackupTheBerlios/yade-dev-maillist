<PRE>Sorry for errors. I will fix them in the next svn...

&gt;<i> 1. First and foremost, you HAVE TO document new classes you create, so
</I>&gt;<i> that other people can use them (filtering engines look very useful,
</I>&gt;<i> btw). (it was the same with facets, which are great, please bear this in
</I>&gt;<i> mind)
</I>I agree. The documentation should be created more accurately as YADE is _very_ badly documented (though it does not prevent it to use to me :), but strongly prevented to master...). In the future I will document more accurately (unfortunately, now I have no time for this purpose at all).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Does it seem right to put filtering engines into MetBody::engines as
</I>&gt;<i> they are used only for scene rendering. 
</I>and for data probing  may be...

&gt;<i> Perhaps adding filter to 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenGLRenderingEngine would make more sense? 
</I>Perhaps... But I don't know what is OpenGLRenderingEngine and how it work.
(and I haven't time to know it without documentation ). 

&gt;<i> Clipping planes and such 
</I>&gt;<i> could be moved to those pre-rendering engines. 
</I>Yes, I think about it too.

&gt;<i> In such way, those 
</I>&gt;<i> engines would not be run if you don't need the rendering - like if you
</I>&gt;<i> run without GL or if drawing is slower than simulation; they would be
</I>&gt;<i> run only right before drawing. 
</I>And now it is. Those engines would be run if they is activated from GUI.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Added: trunk/core/FiltrEngine.cpp
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> 3. I moved it to common, which seems like more appropriate space
</I>&gt;<i> (comment in the commit log). (FilterEngine? Filtr looks like a typo...)
</I>Ok. I will fix it.
Question: how it is possible to make a legend, for example, with velocity colour scale?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Would you mind running compilation before you commit? You were
</I>&gt;<i> missing one logger 
</I>Hm.. I haven't errors with it.... 

&gt;<i> and had FiltrationalEngine.hpp instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> FiltrEngine.hpp in the player and other errors.
</I>Sorry.

&gt;<i> 6. Can you please decrease vertical size of the player window and put
</I>&gt;<i> filtration button elsewhere (decrease the message area, get rid of
</I>&gt;<i> baseName boxes etc) or something? It doesn't fit on the screen with
</I>&gt;<i> 1024x768!
</I>I have not understood a problem. At me the sizes of a window change. 
The sizes of its boxes also change...
