&gt;<i> (b) unfortunately we have no consensus. You have changed the default
</I>&gt;<i> view direction and it turned out to be particularly annoying for me,
</I>&gt;<i> because lattice is in XY plane. So I was always looking at it from
</I>&gt;<i> side. And I have to patiently rotate the camera with mouse until I
</I>&gt;<i> could see my sample. That was driving me nuts :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I could not just change the default view direction, because then
</I>&gt;<i> you would be driven nuts, that you always have to rotate the view to
</I>&gt;<i> see your sample (just like I currently had).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore there is no best default view direction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I concluded that we need an easy way to switch view directions. One
</I>&gt;<i> XYZ button for me, another ZXY button for you, and third button to
</I>&gt;<i> stay complete with all possibilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And since there is no best default view, I decided to have something
</I>&gt;<i> like an &quot;overall view&quot; - which in general is a kind of axisymmetric
</I>&gt;<i> look. Then the only choice I was left with was direction of gravity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you see my reasoning now? Can you think of any better solution
</I>&gt;<i> for that?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>OK, let's keep it as it is. I would prefer keyboard shortcuts for this,
but xyz is already taken for grid. Perhaps xyz for directions and XYZ
for grid would be ok. (Those 3 buttons are quite large and to be
consistent, you would have to put many other view controls there.)
(Orienting by gravity engine is non-obvious and will probably make
people wonder what determines the default orientation - until they read
the code ;-) )
&gt;<i> did you svn up? It works for me:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. generate a simulation (it autoloads)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. click XYZ/... buttons to change view.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Curiously, it works now (I meant: without any simulation loaded; but
that works now as well).

Oh, BTW, since you're the openGL specialist, could you review the scale
code in GLViewer? It should display 10^n long line segments in axis
directions (in the upper left corner) to give an idea of the scene
scale. Obviously, it is fully meaningful only with the ISO view, but
with perspective, it should show scale on the zMid plane. It doesn't
work in either case (try zooming in etc.), it is weird.
