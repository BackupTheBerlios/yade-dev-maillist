<PRE>Sega, I unfortunately had commit conflict with you and hope that my
commits didn't break your things, please verify that. Player is now able
to use simulation saved in sqlite and I had to merge your changes by hand.

I have a few remarks:

1. First and foremost, you HAVE TO document new classes you create, so
that other people can use them (filtering engines look very useful,
btw). (it was the same with facets, which are great, please bear this in
mind)

2. Does it seem right to put filtering engines into MetBody::engines as
they are used only for scene rendering. Perhaps adding filter to
OpenGLRenderingEngine would make more sense? Clipping planes and such
could be moved to those pre-rendering engines. In such way, those
engines would not be run if you don't need the rendering - like if you
run without GL or if drawing is slower than simulation; they would be
run only right before drawing. It is just a suggestion, I haven;t
thought that through.

&gt;<i> Added: trunk/core/FiltrEngine.cpp
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>3. I moved it to common, which seems like more appropriate space
(comment in the commit log). (FilterEngine? Filtr looks like a typo...)
&gt;<i> Modified: trunk/core/Omega.cpp
</I>&gt;<i> +void Omega::setCurrentIteration(long int i) { currentIteration=i; }
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I moved iteration to MetaBody and adjusted this.

&gt;<i> +	Omega::instance().setCurrentIteration(atoi(fileName.substr(fileName.rfind('_')+1).c_str()));
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>4. Added the same for sqlite here.

5. Would you mind running compilation before you commit? You were
missing one logger and had FiltrationalEngine.hpp instead of
FiltrEngine.hpp in the player and other errors.

6. Can you please decrease vertical size of the player window and put
filtration button elsewhere (decrease the message area, get rid of
baseName boxes etc) or something? It doesn't fit on the screen with
1024x768!

Best, Vaclav
