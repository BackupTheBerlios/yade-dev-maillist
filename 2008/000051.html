<PRE>
&gt;<i> ok, this one is easy - just declare another variable before the loop,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> InteractionContainer::iterator e=interactions-&gt;end();
</I>&gt;<i>  for(InteractionContainer::iterator I=interactions-&gt;begin(); I!=e; ++I)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I was trying to adapt Yade containers to boost::range recently so that
BOOST_FOREACH would work with them. It does exactly this optimization
(it is called &quot;hoisting&quot;, they say) and is much nicer:
foreach(interactions,I){...}. Will retry.

It can't be optimized by the compiler, since the container may change
during the loop body execution... (perhaps I did say once it would...
sorry).
&gt;&gt;<i> (3) actionStiffness-&gt;getClassIndex() is always executed too. It is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better to add a member data stiffnessIndex to the engine, then define it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only once as stiffnessIndex=actionStiffness-&gt;getClassIndex() in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constructor, and finally use stiffnessIndex for internal tests instead 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of getClassIndex(). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> getClassIndex() returns only a member static variable of a class.
</I>&gt;<i> I can't belive that it will be faster more than 0.5% if you create
</I>&gt;<i> another variable and access this one instead of that original static
</I>&gt;<i> one. Is that really the case?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>getClassIndex is still a virtual function which has some dispatch
overhead, and there is a function call (getClassIndexStatic) inside.
There will be some cost of that.
&gt;<i> &quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Last time I had flu and headache it was not because of premature
optimization. If that is not &quot;evil&quot;, consider 2nd world was, which was
not caused by premature optimization either.
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (what is the optimization level whith scons flag &quot;optimization=True&quot;, is it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> equivalent to -O3?).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if you look into SConscript, you will see that it's '-O3 -ffast-math'
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Or if you run scons pretty=0, which will show all commands.
&gt;&gt;<i> Afer fixing things here and there concerning those 3 points above (e.g. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I added a member data called &quot;size&quot; to the container to avoid computing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it all the time), 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in fact you can do whatever you want with the containers, because we
</I>&gt;<i> are switching boost::multi_index as soon as I ... do all my non-yade
</I>&gt;<i> development work. Uh, I wish I've been paid to work on yade, not some
</I>&gt;<i> other unrelated stuff, this is killing me. I want to develop yade
</I>&gt;<i> itself but I can't. But everyone is using yade and they need it better.
</I>&gt;<i> But now I have to do snow, concrete and that stuff...
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Janek, is multi_index random-access in O(1)? That is important if we try
to use openMP, which can parallelize some loops by itself.
&gt;&gt;<i> I could run the triaxial test around 25% faster.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can commit those changes soon, I'm curious to know the results on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other computers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>Great improvement, Bruno. I will run kcallgrind also, it seems very useful.

V.
