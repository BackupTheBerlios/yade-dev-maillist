Ok, thank you for details.
I wonder if we can't move clumps at the end of MB-&gt;bodies without 
changing ids...

For clump members velocity it should be easy to define in the 
displacement engine.

Va'clav S a e'crit :
&gt;&gt;<i> 1/ Forces are damped based on the motion of each body. As a consequence, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different contact forces on the same clump will be damped independently. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Its a bit like damping separately each individual force applied on a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standalone body. The very bad effect of this is that a body at static 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> equilibrium can be moved out of equilibrium by damping effect (i.e. the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exact opposite of what damping is supposed to do...).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The correct way to damp is to damp the resultant force/moment on a clump 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on the motion of the clump.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't sure what the correct way was, but please fell free to adjust
</I>&gt;<i> that. If you do, however, make sure that the same is done in the
</I>&gt;<i> original engines (CundallNonViscous etc) so that the behavior is consistent.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2/ From what I see in the code, if a clump has bodies &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fear the integration loop could make something like (depending on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ordering of bodies):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on body i : clump-&gt;acceleration += i-&gt;force/clump-&gt;mass
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on clump : clump-&gt;velocity += clump-&gt;acceleration*dt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on body j : clump-&gt;acceleration += j-&gt;force/clump-&gt;mass
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so that forces on clump member j are ignored in the motion of the clump...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there something to prevent that? Are clumps always at the end of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loop?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, the ordering of IDs of clump and its members is undefined.
</I>&gt;<i> There are 2 ways out of this, it seems to me:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Add an extra loop that would apply forces on clump members to clump
</I>&gt;<i> itself, before calculating clump acceleration. Perhaps a flag on
</I>&gt;<i> NewtonsDampedLaw so that the loop would be run only if clumps were
</I>&gt;<i> actually in use. That could be either set by the user (like you have to
</I>&gt;<i> set distant flag for the collider to make it work) or by the engine
</I>&gt;<i> itself: at each iteration, it would remember whether some bodies were
</I>&gt;<i> actually clumps - if so, the flag would be turned on and you would get
</I>&gt;<i> the extra loop run at next iteration; you would miss just the first
</I>&gt;<i> iteration, which is negligible. If the clump loop would run , at some
</I>&gt;<i> point, without doing any work, it would switch that flag off automatically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Prescribe such ordering of clumps and its members so that the problem
</I>&gt;<i> is prevented. It is not very user-friendly, but could be enforced by
</I>&gt;<i> assertions/exceptions when the clump is created. But having bodies
</I>&gt;<i> behave depending on their ID seems weird (non-intuitive).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS. I wonder if there is anyone using clumps actually (I don't need them
</I>&gt;<i> now); there can be problem with shear forces, since clump members have
</I>&gt;<i> zero velocities, even if they move (they are moved by a special engine);
</I>&gt;<i> since shear displacement is frequently calculated from angularVelocity,
</I>&gt;<i> it will give zero. It could be fixed (angularVelocity of each member
</I>&gt;<i> would be calculated from clump's angular velocity) but it has not been
</I>&gt;<i> done yet.
