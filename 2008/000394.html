<PRE>
V&#225;clav S a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Jerome,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am sorry, but how about some more meaningful name instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ContactLaw1&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I am even more sorry than you but I have sincerely not much idea. As I 
wrote it in the files this law is in fact quite similar to the 
CohesiveFrictionnalContactLaw. The differences are :
- there is nothing more linked with &quot;brokenBodies&quot;
- no creep (I just noticed that I could have suppressed the comments, sorry)
- no more adhesion or cohesion
- the main new point is the inelastic behaviour in compression, with the 
&quot;coeff_dech&quot; variable
And as in CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw there is computation of moment 
for example.
Because I personnly didn't understand, thanks to the name, that for 
example in CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw you can simulate moment transfer 
or creep (that's the same for all contact laws and I would even say that 
for all the yade source files ;-) ) I didn't indeed search for an other 
name... Maybe &quot;InelasticCompressionAndMomentTransferContactLaw&quot; ?? But I 
thought you don't like long names... So again very sorry : I don't want 
to offense anyone but sincerely I don't see which name I could give... 
If the suggestion above satisfies you, or if you have better ideas, feel 
free to rename it, I don't mind (it honours you to look after meaningful 
names !)
NB : Moreover I don't know how to rename svn tracked files...
&gt;<i> Second, for the roll angle and so on: I would be glad if those things
</I>&gt;<i> could move to SpheresContactGeometry, like I did it with shear, so that
</I>&gt;<i> constitutive laws don't repeat the same code over and over (the same for
</I>&gt;<i> twisting).
</I>&gt;<i> If you can elaborate what angle do you need for your law and
</I>&gt;<i> how tom compute it from geometry, I will try to implement that within
</I>&gt;<i> the contact geom.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards, Vaclav
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I understand it very well. I didn't notice you made attempts in this 
field, sorry. All that concerns moment transfer was purely and simply 
copied-pasted from CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw (with only the add a of 
plastic threshold). So I believe that this is Janek who wrote the lines 
I copied, so I think that he would answer you much better than me... 
This work has not yet been done also in CohesiveFrictionalContactLaw 
isn't it ?

Tell me if you have other remarks, I'll try to answer as better as I 
can... (that was the case in this mail even if I could not answer you 
precisely !)

Jerome
