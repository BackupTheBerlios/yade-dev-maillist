&gt;<i> we tried to migrate once. The problem was an insanely long first
</I>&gt;<i> checkout and huge amount of used disk space. Does this problem is
</I>&gt;<i> still present in BZR ? Also see:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two years passed since then, so BZR should have improved now.
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>The initial full checkout is quite fast if you get the full history (say 
a few minutes, depending on your connection; the very low speed was 
caused by many roundtrips), which takes something like 40MB on the disk 
(just guessing, as there is only a part of history in at the launchpad 
mirror branch). Then, all operations (like diff) are local and run fast.

If you do a shallow checkout (just the latest version), it is very fast. 
On the other hand, all commands on the branch depend on access to the 
repository (including diff); speaking of myself, I use this only before 
commit to check what everything changes, so no big deal.

There is a feature called &quot;history horizons&quot; in development, that will 
allow you to get just a few version's history; that would be best for 
us, but it is not yet available (maybe in a few months?).

For my part, what I find the most compelling is the ability to commit 
locally (and revert etc), so you can save snapshots of your work and 
push to the shared repository only once everything works. Handling 
renames and moves is more intelligent. And we would have most things at 
launchpad, which would allos us to easily have separate branch for a 
release backporting some fixes and so on. Brnching is very powerful 
concept and bzr is nice that it allows you to have decentralized 
workflow, but also centralized (svn-like) one if you want so.
