<PRE>Hello

I'd like to discuss the meaning of isDynamic and how it modifies the 
behaviour of a body on one timestep (especialy with Va&#231;lav and Sega. I 
also changed my mind concerning shearForce vs. shearDisp updating - see 
the end of this message).
There are currently some inconsistencies, some due to the fact I 
sometimes used isDynamic to test if a body was actually a box or a 
sphere, then others used it to test if a kinematicEngine was assigned to 
the body, etc.

I explain here the isDynamic logic as I would like it.

isDynamic means : acceleration = force/mass.
!isDynamic means : acceleration is something else, or even it is left 
undefined.

However, !isDynamic doesn't mean that a body has no velocity. This 
velocity can be constantly zero, or constantly something, or constantly 
changing based on a kinematic engine.

Variables like shear diplacements should be computed exactly the same 
way, based on motion, whatever the dynamic status. It is the 
responsability of the user to define correct velocities/positions if 
needed for non-dynamic bodies (in the simplest case vel=0, there is 
nothing special to do).

The advantage of this approach is that the we don't need to develop 
different code for dynamic and non-dynamic spheres.

This simple thing should be possible :
- Set a sphere !isDynamic (or block some DOF's)
- Assign it a velocity and a rotationalVelocity (or assign components 
corresponding to the fixed DOF's)
- Run
- The sphere move at constant velocity (or with one component constant), 
and interact with other bodies the usual way, with no extra engine.

It is currently not possible for at least two reasons. One reason can be 
seen in updateShearForce :

if (isDynamic1) summaryAngularVelocity += rbp1-&gt;angularVelocity;
if (isDynamic2) summaryAngularVelocity += rbp2-&gt;angularVelocity;
angle = dt*0.5*normal.Dot(summaryAngularVelocity);

So, the motion of non-dynamic spheres will be ignored : not good. I 
would disregard isDyn1/isDyn2 in this part of the code. I would also 
disregard it here (svn blame-&gt;Sega) :

Vector3r _c1x_    = (isDynamic1) ? 
currentContactGeometry-&gt;radius1*currentContactGeometry-&gt;normal : x - 
de1-&gt;zeroPoint;
Vector3r _c2x_    = (isDynamic2) ? 
-currentContactGeometry-&gt;radius2*currentContactGeometry-&gt;normal : x - 
de2-&gt;zeroPoint;

And I would always set : Vector3r _c1x_    = 
currentContactGeometry-&gt;radius1*currentContactGeometry-&gt;normal.

 From my point of view, the elastic law is broken for rotating spheres 
now, since I will never set zeroPoint for non-dynamic spheres.
This code I suggest will not work for non-spherical rotating bodies, but 
this class is for sphere/sphere contacts, so...

The second reason : Newtons law is skipping bodies as soon as !isDynamic 
currently. It should pass the acceleration part of the code only.

Conclusion : I would remove the parameters ks, isDynamic1, isDynamic2 
from the function :

updateShearForce(Vector3r&amp; shearForce, Real ks, const Vector3r&amp; 
prevNormal, const RigidBodyParameters* rbp1, const RigidBodyParameters* 
rbp2, bool isDynamic1, bool isDynamic2, Real dt, bool 
avoidGranularRatcheting)

Updating the shear force (instead of shear disp.) is correct, I changed 
my mind while typing this mail. We need to rotate the current force, not 
only compute the new displacement. The multiplication by ks can still be 
moved out of the update function.

I could modify the Newtons law quickly if everybody agree that the 
position of a !dynamic body can be time-integrated the usual way based 
on velocities.
However, I suspect there would be a problem with kinematic engines, 
because Newtons law and engines would both set the positions.
There could be different flags for acceleration and velocity (isDynamic 
:<i> acceleration time-integration gives vel / isKinematic : velocity 
</I>time-integration gives position), but I don't like new flags...
Kinematic engines could perhaps just erase the result of Newton 
integration and set its own independent values if it is put after time 
integration in the loop? Any toher idea?

Side note : another question about zeroPoint is a bit the same as the 
previous one about interaction data, do we really need this for all 
bodies in all simulations?
